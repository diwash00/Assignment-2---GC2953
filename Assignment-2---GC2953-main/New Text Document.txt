The application should fetch data from a movie-related API and provide users with details about different movies, including their titles, release dates, genres, and more.

Features:

Movie List: Display a list of popular or trending movies with basic information (title, poster image, release date).
Search Functionality: Implement a search bar that allows users to search for movies by title, genre, or actor.
Movie Details: When a user clicks on a movie, show detailed information such as the synopsis, cast, director, and user ratings.
Dynamic UI: Use JavaFX components to create a dynamic and visually appealing user interface.
Trailer Integration: Optionally, integrate movie trailers (via YouTube API or similar) for selected movies.
Favorites and Watchlist: Allow users to mark movies as favorites or add them to a watchlist for future reference.
Implementation Steps:

Choose a movie-related API (such as The Movie Database API) and obtain an API key.
Set up your JavaFX project and design the user interface with a movie list and details pane.
Implement the logic to make API requests for retrieving movie information.
Parse the JSON data from the API to extract details about each movie.
Display the list of movies in the JavaFX interface.
Implement the search functionality to filter the movie list based on user input.
When a user clicks on a movie, dynamically update the details pane with comprehensive information about that movie.
Optionally, integrate trailer playback functionality for selected movies.
Allow users to mark movies as favorites or add them to a watchlist.
Tips:

Pay attention to error handling, especially when dealing with potential issues like API request failures or missing data.
Enhance the user experience with visually appealing layouts and images.
Consider using background threads for API requests to prevent freezing the UI during data retrieval.
This project provides a fun and engaging way to work with movie-related data, API integration, and user interface design within a JavaFX application.
